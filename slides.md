# Election categories

  - Workers' councils


---

# French Presidential and Legislative Elections

## Presidential Elections:
- Direct election by popular vote
- Two-round system: If no candidate wins a majority in the first round, the top two candidates face off in a second round

## Legislative Elections (National Assembly):
- Single-member districts
- Two-round system: If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round, a second round is held
- Candidates in second round: All candidates who received at least 12.5% of the vote in the first round

# Plurality Voting vs Proportional Representation

::left::

## Plurality Voting
- **Key Features:**
  - Single-member districts; candidate with most votes wins
  - Districts are represented, not electorate's preferences
  - Simple and clear winner, potentially stable governments
  - Often leads to two-party dominance
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Disproportionate representation
  - Multiple similar candidates spoil the vote favoring the opposite candidate

::right::

## Proportional Representation
- **Key Features:**
  - Seats distributed by vote percentage
  - Accurate representation of electorate's preferences
  - Encourages multi-party systems and diverse viewpoints
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Complex processes and potential for coalition governments

# Example of spoiling the vote for the opposition

## US Presidential Election of 1992

- Candidates: Bill Clinton (Democrat), George H.W. Bush (Republican), and Ross Perot (Independent).
- Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman, took 19% of the votes arguably contributing to Clinton's victory.

## US Presidential Election of 2000
- Candidates: George W. Bush (Republican), Al Gore (Democrat), Ralph Nader (Green Party)
- Ralph Nader took votes from Al Gore ensuring George W. Bush won the elections


<!--
Of course the US system has the electoral college. 
The popular vote is already less important than geographical representation

# Do we need party lists for Proportianal Representation for our Workers' Council?

- Plurality Voting is simple, but
  - Similar candidates spoil the vote for the opposition
- Larger companies have party lists for workers' councils
- Proportional Representation is what we want, but we have no parties

# Dáil Éireann Elections in Ireland
- Single Transferable Vote (STV) system
  - Voters rank candidates in order of preference
- Multiple District (Unlike single district in NL)
- Competition between candidates of the same party and district
- Quota system
  - Candidates need to reach a certain quota of votes to be elected
- Surplus and transfer
  - Excess votes for elected candidates are transferred to next preferences
  - Eliminated candidates' votes are also transferred to next preferences

# Other election approaches
## Block voting
- Every voter divides the number of seats among the candidates
- Only one vote per candidate
- Most votes win the seat

## Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP):
- Hybrid system combines elements of Plurality Voting and Proportional Representation
- Voters two votes: 
  - one for a candidate in their single-member district
  - one for a party list
- This method is used in countries like Germany and New Zealand.

## Instant Runoff
Single Tranferable Vote for 1 Seat
